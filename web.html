                <p class='details'>TAP (PROOF OF CONCEPT)<br>This was the final project I worked on at General Assembly. <a href='http://tap-in.bitballoon.com'>tap-in.com</a> is a P2P wifi-sharing app, where 'lenders' can register their private home network to be 'borrowed' by other users. A borrower would pay a $10/mo subscription and have unlimited wifi-access to any lender's network in range of their device's current location. For the lender, it's a way to make passive income by simply having your router on. I assume you are probably thinking, "isn't a borrower of my network going to be able to log in anytime without the app since they have my password?"
Well-- thats what makes Tap special, we don't exchange passwords. Tap is anonymous, so only your network name and speed is shared with borrowers. Your password is entered upon registration and so is your payment info, so the only thing you have to do is Tap to connect. It's that easy. Never spend 2 hours on the phone with Time-Warner cable again. Never feel like you're committing a crime by going over your monthly data plan. Let's all Tap in and build the wifi-sharing community! </p>
